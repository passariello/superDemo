  "description": "2015 IPA is Dead Series. Supremely floral, this hugely under-rated hop is related to Galaxy and was first cultivated in the Australian state of Victoria. Initially given the same name as a certain Eurolager, their lawyers got involved and the St- prefix was dropped. Ella displays subtle notes of spice, but is fundamentally a truly floral bouquet, redolent of the Southern Hemisphere.",
