  "description": "Brewed with 100% malt, ten times the hops of most industrial lagers and cold-conditioned for five weeks, this spicy, robust Pilsner is lager reborn. Expect a robust, full-bodied malt character on the front of the tongue, spicy citrus notes as it goes back through the palate and an assertive bitter finish with a lemon and pepper character to round things off.",

  "brewers_tips": "The most important thing about making a lager? Fermentation temperature! Do everything you can to control the ambient temperature to 9 - 12°C. In the old days, they used to brew lager over winter, so the colder temperature gave a much preferable fermentation profile. Ferment too hot and you beer will taste like yeasty bread.",
