  "description": "Brewed to 8.5%, light as a mass market Pilsner in colour, fermented to be as dry as a Lambic, but as bitter as any double IPA and loaded with as much hop aroma as we can get into a beer. The fermentables in this beer were Maris Otter Extra Pale along with plenty of sugar as we mashed at a very low temperature to ensure maximum fermentability and attenuation. This beer is fermented within an inch of its life making it dry, sheer and bright. Citra, Amarillo & Centennial were all used in abundance in the kettle and also fired extremely liberally at this beer with our high tech hop cannon.",
