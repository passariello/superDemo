  "brewers_tips": "When you have a good lactobacillus culture grown take half of an fv of it and add some fresh wort. This will keep the culture alive as long as you keep it warm, oxygen free and keep releasing the pressure. You can then use this liquid culture on the next brew and reuse it over and over and over and over and over...like sourdough starter!",
