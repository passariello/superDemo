  "description": "Two of Europe's most experimental, boundary-pushing brewers, BrewDog and Mikkeller, combined forces to produce a rebellious beer that combined their respective talents and brewing skills. The 12.5% Barley Wine fermented well, and the champagne yeast drew it ever closer to 12.5%. The beer was brewed with a single hop variety and was going to be partially aged in oak casks.",
